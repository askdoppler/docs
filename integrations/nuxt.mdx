Once you have created an account on [Doppler](https://askdoppler.com) and created an API Key, you can proceed with the next steps.

## Installation

Pick your package manager and install the SDK.

<CodeGroup>

```json npm
npm install @askdoppler/nuxt
```

```json yarn
yarn add @askdoppler/nuxt
```

```json pnpm
pnpm add @askdoppler/nuxt
```

```json bun
bun add @askdoppler/nuxt
```

</CodeGroup>

## Nuxt configuration

Edit `nuxt.config.ts` and add the following code:

1. Append `@askdoppler/nuxt` to the `modules` array like so:

```ts nuxt.config.ts
modules: [
  "@askdoppler/nuxt", // place first or in early positions if can't place first
  // ... other modules
];
```

<Warning>
  Try to place it as early as possible in the `modules` array to ensure the
  middleware is prioritized.
</Warning>

2. Add the following configuration object to your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```json nuxt.config.ts
doppler: {
  apiKey: "your-api-key"
}
```
